# Abstract
The aim of this work is to develop suitable process dynamic analysis and control strategies for implementing cogeneration unit (COGEN) as a flare utilization alternative to handle unexpected disturbances from unknown and uncertain flare sources. The developed steady state and dynamic simulations using Aspen Plus and Aspen Plus Dynamics allow the design of pressure and temperature controllers that demonstrate good performance. The simulation software and its built-in controller tuning option are used to create the dynamic modelling framework, and to perform controller installation and design. Finally, the proposed process dynamic analysis and control strategies are evaluated using an illustrative regulatory case study. It included disturbance rejection capability assessment in the presence of unexpected pressure load disturbances as well as temperature excursions from desirable operating conditions. The simple designed controller and its automated monitoring systems offered means of evaluating COGEN as a flare utilization alternative, while providing insights in to the techno-economic performance of the system.
